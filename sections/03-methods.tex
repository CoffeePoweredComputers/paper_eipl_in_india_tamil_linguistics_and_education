This study employs a qualitative approach where we observe both novices and
experts who's mother tongue is Tamil solving a variety of prompting exercises.
In Section~\ref{sec:eipl-activities} we cover the the variety of prompting
activities we use as the means of exploring how users prompt in Tamil. In
Section~\ref{sec:data-collection-analysis} we cover the data collection and
analysis we employ in investigating our research questions.

To explore how novices and experts alike approach prompting large language
models when articulating computational tasks we employ ``Explain in Plain
Language'' activities. This activity is derived from the ``Explain in Plain
English'' task which is commonly used in introductory programming courses to
evaluate the ability to comprehend code and articulate its purpose in natural
language.
