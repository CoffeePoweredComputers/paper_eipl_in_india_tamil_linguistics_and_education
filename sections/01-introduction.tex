In \citet{jordan2024need}, they found that amoung the languages under their
consideration, English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Tamil, the worst performing
language was Tamil, generating incorrect solutions and non-sensiable
translations. Though the authors did not systematically investigate the the
nature of the poor performance or methods of improvement, they did note several
possible reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  \item Compared to English and Spanish it was likely a lower resourced language
    in the training data.
\end{enumerate}
The first of these two possibilities is, perhaps, the most interesting. In
Tamil, there are two core dialects which differ significantly: literary Tamil
(sen-Tamil) and colloquial (kodun-Tamil)~\cite{}. Additionally, given Tamil is
spoken not just in and around Tamil Nadu, but also in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and
Singapore, there are a number of regional dialects~\cite{}.
